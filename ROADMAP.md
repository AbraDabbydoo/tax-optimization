## calculateandstoreagi (AGI Calculation Utility)

The AGI calculation utility (see [lib/utils.ts](lib/utils.ts)) currently does not collect the following IRS "above-the-line" adjustments or income inputs. These should be added to the user input flow in future updates:

### Missing AGI Inputs/Adjustments
- Educator expenses
- Moving expenses for military
- Self-employment tax deduction (50%)
- Self-employed health insurance deduction
- Penalty on early withdrawal of savings
- Student loan interest deduction
- Tuition and fees deduction
- Other less common adjustments (e.g., jury duty pay given to employer)

**Note:**
- These fields are set to `0` in the AGI calculation until user input is collected.
- See the implementation in [lib/utils.ts](lib/utils.ts) for details and update points.
